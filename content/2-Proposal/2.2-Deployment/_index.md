# CI/CD — Design & Step-by-Step Setup Guide

Summary:

- **Owner:** Hieu (Backend — Repo & Deployment, assigned 07/05/2026)
- **Audience:** the whole team (FE: Danh, Hung · BE: Thanh, Nguyen, Hieu)
- **Stack:** React + Vite (TS) on Amplify · FastAPI (Python) on EC2/ASG · Lambda + SAM · RDS PostgreSQL

### 1. CI/CD Design Overview

**Design principle:** GitHub Actions as the single orchestrator; AWS-native services as deploy targets. Two repositories split along team ownership — `court-booking-frontend` (Danh & Hung) and `court-booking-backend` (FastAPI + Lambdas, BE team) — with three deployment paths matching the three architecture zones:

| Component                       | Pipeline                                              | Rationale                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Frontend** (React + Vite)     | Amplify Hosting built-in CI/CD                        | Already in the architecture diagram; free build minutes, automatic **PR preview URLs** for UI review, one-click rollback, zero YAML to maintain.                                |
| **Backend** (FastAPI on EC2)    | GitHub Actions → AWS CodeDeploy → ASG rolling deploy  | CodeDeploy is **Auto-Scaling-aware**: instances launched later by the ASG automatically receive the latest revision. ELB-health-gated rollout = zero downtime with 2 instances. |
| **Lambdas** (payment + confirm) | GitHub Actions → AWS SAM                              | Both functions + API Gateway + SNS wiring as reviewable infrastructure-as-code in one `template.yaml`.                                                                          |
| **DB migrations** (Alembic)     | Pipeline step before backend deploy, run once via SSM | Prevents schema drift; the exclusion constraint lives in a versioned migration.                                                                                                 |

**Cross-cutting decisions:**

1. **GitHub OIDC → IAM roles** — no long-lived AWS keys in GitHub secrets; one least-privilege role per pipeline.
2. **Two repos along team ownership** — FE and BE ship on independent cadences; API contract drift between them is caught by an OpenAPI type-check job in the frontend repo (§4.3). Inside the backend repo, path filters keep the backend and lambda pipelines independent.
3. **Two environments, gated** — merges auto-deploy to dev; prod waits behind a GitHub Environment approval.
4. **Quality gates on every PR** — `ruff` + `pytest` (+ Postgres service container), `tsc` + `eslint` + `vitest`.

#### Alternatives considered — and why they weren't picked

**Full AWS CodePipeline + CodeBuild** end-to-end would be the "pure AWS" answer, but: CodeBuild costs money per build minute where GitHub Actions is free for public/edu repos, the developer experience is clunkier (log diving in the console vs. PR-inline checks), and the team already lives in GitHub. We still get real AWS-service depth via CodeDeploy + SAM + Amplify + OIDC/IAM — arguably the best of both worlds, and each of those is a résumé-relevant AWS service.

**A single monorepo instead of two repos.** One repo gives atomic cross-stack PRs and a single review flow — attractive on paper. But the FE pair and the BE trio barely touch each other's code, the toolchains are disjoint (npm vs. Python), and Amplify connects more simply to a dedicated frontend repo. The one monorepo advantage that genuinely matters — keeping the API contract in sync — is recovered by the OpenAPI type-generation check (§4.3), so the repo boundary follows the team boundary instead.

**Containers on ECS/Fargate instead of EC2 + CodeDeploy.** Containerizing FastAPI would modernize the deploy story (immutable images, local/prod parity), but it replaces the EC2 monolith committed to in the [Architecture Design](../2.1-architecture/) — a different compute architecture, not just a different pipeline. It also adds Docker, ECR, and ECS as three new things to learn inside an 8-week window, for no functional gain at this scale. Worth revisiting after the program if the app lives on.

**Docker on EC2 — same architecture, containerized packaging.** Distinct from the ECS option above: the ASG + ELB + CodeDeploy design stays untouched; only the packaging changes (CI builds an image, pushes to Amazon ECR, and the CodeDeploy hooks swap `pip install`/`systemctl` for `docker pull`/`docker run`). The upside is real — one image ends environment drift across 3 dev machines + CI + EC2, and deploys stop running `pip install` on live instances. Not adopted initially because it adds Docker, ECR, and the Apple-Silicon cross-build gotcha (`docker buildx --platform linux/amd64`) to an already full learning budget. **Decision rule:** if the team loses more than ~half a day to environment drift ("passes on my machine, fails in CI"), switch at that point — the refit is cheap precisely because CodeDeploy stays. Until then, two low-cost measures capture most of the parity benefit: the committed `.python-version` (§2.4, step 2) and running local Postgres via Docker Compose (§2.4, step 6).

**CDK or Terraform instead of SAM for the serverless path.** Terraform brings third-party state management, which cuts against the "maximise AWS services" principle. CDK is excellent but is a general-purpose IaC framework — heavier to learn than SAM's declarative template for what is exactly two functions, one HTTP API, and one SNS topic. SAM is the smallest tool that does the job, and a SAM → CDK migration later is straightforward.

**GitHub Actions → S3 + CloudFront for the frontend instead of Amplify.** More control (cache policies, invalidations), but everything Amplify gives for free would have to be hand-rolled — most importantly per-PR preview URLs, which is the FE team's entire review loop.

#### Prerequisites and constraints

1. **CodeDeploy's agent setup on EC2 has a learning curve** (install the agent in launch-template user-data, `appspec.yml` hooks). Budget half a day for it. The fallback if it fights you: GitHub Actions → SSM `RunCommand` with a deploy script — simpler, but it loses ASG-awareness and native rollback, so treat it as plan B only.
2. **Lambda-in-VPC needs a route to the internet.** The process-payment function sits in private subnets to reach RDS — but if it must _call out_ to the payment gateway's API (verify signatures, query transaction status), private subnets have no internet route. Options: a NAT gateway (~$32/month — nearly doubles the project budget), a NAT instance on a t3.micro (free-tier-friendly, more ops work), or designing the webhook flow so the Lambda never initiates outbound calls (authenticate the incoming payload via HMAC signature instead). Decide this **before** wiring the subnets/SGs in the SAM template.
3. **CloudFormation deploys are not instant.** `sam deploy` runs a changeset — expect 1–3 minutes even for a one-line Lambda change. That's normal; don't chase it.
4. **The migration step assumes at least one healthy instance is running.** The SSM step targets the first running tagged instance — fine at this scale, but it's an assumption worth knowing when debugging a first-ever deploy into an empty ASG.

> Placeholders used throughout — replace globally before running anything:
> `<ACCOUNT_ID>` (12-digit AWS account), `<REGION>` (e.g. `ap-southeast-1`), `<GH_ORG>` (GitHub org or username). The two repos are named `court-booking-frontend` and `court-booking-backend`.

### 2. Repository Initialization

#### 2.1 Create the two repositories

The repo boundary follows the team boundary: the FE pair owns one repo, the BE trio owns the other. The Lambdas live **with the backend** — they share the database schema, the Alembic migration history, and the same owners.

```bash
gh repo create <GH_ORG>/court-booking-frontend --private --clone
gh repo create <GH_ORG>/court-booking-backend  --private --clone

cd court-booking-frontend
mkdir -p src .github/workflows

cd ../court-booking-backend
mkdir -p backend/app backend/alembic backend/deploy/scripts lambdas/process_payment lambdas/confirm_booking .github/workflows
```

Target structures:

```

```

#### 2.2 Branch protection (both repos)

GitHub → each repo → **Settings → Branches → Add rule** for `main`:

- Require a pull request before merging (1 approval)
- Require status checks to pass — frontend repo: `ci / quality`, `ci / contract`; backend repo: `ci / backend`, `ci / lambdas` (selectable after the first CI run)
- Do not allow bypassing the above settings

#### 2.3 GitHub Environments (deploy gate — backend repo only)

The deploy gates live in the **backend repo** (the frontend deploys via Amplify, where merge-to-main is already protected by PR review):

GitHub → `court-booking-backend` → **Settings → Environments**:

1. Create `dev` — no protection rules (auto-deploy on merge).
2. Create `prod` — Required reviewers → add Hieu. Every prod deploy then waits for one click of approval.

> **Cross-repo convention:** for features touching both sides, the backend PR merges first and reaches dev; the frontend PR follows once the contract check passes against the updated dev API.

#### 2.4 Scaffold the backend repo code (step by step)

Run these on the machine of whoever inits the repo (Hieu). Order matters: scaffold and push **before** configuring branch protection (§2.2), so the status checks exist and are selectable.

**Step 1 — prerequisites (once per machine)**

```bash
git --version            # any recent version
gh auth login            # GitHub CLI, authorized for <GH_ORG>
pyenv install 3.12       # once per machine; matches the EC2 runtime (§5.2)
```

> The team standardizes on **pyenv** for local Python. CI (`actions/setup-python`) and EC2 (`dnf install python3.12`) pin the same 3.12 line, so all three environments match.

**Step 2 — create, clone, and lay out the skeleton**

```bash
gh repo create <GH_ORG>/court-booking-backend --private --clone
cd court-booking-backend
pyenv local 3.12         # writes .python-version — commit it: teammates on pyenv auto-switch
mkdir -p backend/app/routers backend/tests backend/deploy/scripts \
         lambdas/process_payment lambdas/confirm_booking .github/workflows
```

**Step 3 — dependencies + virtualenv**

`backend/requirements.txt`:

```
fastapi
gunicorn
uvicorn[standard]
sqlalchemy>=2.0
psycopg[binary]
alembic
pydantic-settings
boto3
```

`backend/requirements-dev.txt`:

```
-r requirements.txt
pytest
httpx
ruff
```

Two equivalent ways to create the environment — pick either; nothing downstream cares (CI builds its own environment, and the EC2 deploy scripts use `/opt/court-booking/.venv` on the server regardless):

**Variant A — pyenv-virtualenv** (auto-activation; the env lives centrally in `~/.pyenv/versions/`, nothing extra in the repo):

```bash
cd backend
pyenv virtualenv 3.12 fcaj-env
pyenv activate fcaj-env    # add eval "$(pyenv virtualenv-init -)" to ~/.zshrc for per-directory auto-activation
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

> Keep the committed `.python-version` as plain `3.12` (step 2). If you prefer auto-activation via `pyenv local fcaj-env`, be aware it writes the *env name* into `.python-version` — only commit that if the whole team creates an env with the same name.

**Variant B — plain venv** (no extra tooling; the folder lives in the repo and is covered by `.gitignore`):

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate   # `python` resolves to 3.12 via the pyenv shim
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

> Editors auto-discover `.venv` by convention; with Variant A's named env, select the interpreter manually once (VS Code: `Python: Select Interpreter` → the `fcaj-env` entry under pyenv).

**Step 4 — minimal FastAPI app with the `/health` endpoint**

The health endpoint is deliberately the very first code in the repo — it is both the ELB health-check path and CodeDeploy's `validate.sh` target (§5.4).

`backend/app/__init__.py` — empty file.

`backend/app/config.py`:

```python
from pydantic_settings import BaseSettings


class Settings(BaseSettings):
    app_env: str = "local"
    database_url: str = "postgresql+psycopg://app:app@localhost:5432/courtbooking_dev"


settings = Settings()
```

> On EC2 the real `DATABASE_URL` arrives as an environment variable populated from SSM Parameter Store (§3.5); `pydantic-settings` picks it up automatically. Locally the default above is used.

`backend/app/main.py`:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI(title="Court Booking API", version="0.1.0")


@app.get("/api/v1/health")
def health() -> dict:
    return {"status": "ok"}
```

`backend/tests/test_health.py`:

```python
from fastapi.testclient import TestClient

from app.main import app


def test_health():
    r = TestClient(app).get("/api/v1/health")
    assert r.status_code == 200
    assert r.json() == {"status": "ok"}
```

`backend/pyproject.toml` (tooling config):

```toml
[tool.ruff]
line-length = 100

[tool.pytest.ini_options]
pythonpath = ["."]
```

**Step 5 — verify locally before anything else**

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000   # from backend/, venv active
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/health    # → {"status":"ok"}
ruff check . && pytest                      # both must pass
```

**Step 6 — Alembic + the first migration**

```bash
alembic init alembic
```

In the generated `alembic/env.py`, make the URL come from the environment (add after `config = context.config`):

```python
import os

config.set_main_option(
    "sqlalchemy.url",
    os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL", "postgresql+psycopg://app:app@localhost:5432/courtbooking_dev"),
)
```

To run migrations locally without installing Postgres natively, use Docker Compose for the database only — this mirrors what CI does with its service container. `docker-compose.yml` at the repo root:

```yaml
services:
  db:
    image: postgres:16
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: app
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: app
      POSTGRES_DB: courtbooking_dev
    ports: ["5432:5432"]
```

```bash
docker compose up -d db
```

The first migration enables the extension that the double-booking exclusion constraint needs:

```bash
alembic revision -m "enable btree_gist"
```

```python
def upgrade():
    op.execute("CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS btree_gist")


def downgrade():
    op.execute("DROP EXTENSION IF EXISTS btree_gist")
```

**Step 7 — deploy assets**

Copy in the files from §5.2/§5.4: `backend/deploy/appspec.yml`, the four hook scripts under `backend/deploy/scripts/`, and `backend/deploy/court-booking.service`. Then:

```bash
chmod +x deploy/scripts/*.sh
```

**Step 8 — Lambda skeletons**

`lambdas/process_payment/app.py` and `lambdas/confirm_booking/app.py`, each starting as:

```python
def handler(event, context):
    return {"statusCode": 200}
```

Plus `lambdas/template.yaml` and `lambdas/samconfig.toml` from §6.1, `lambdas/requirements-dev.txt` containing `pytest`, and one smoke test `lambdas/test_handlers.py`:

```python
from process_payment.app import handler


def test_handler_returns_200():
    assert handler({}, None)["statusCode"] == 200
```

**Step 9 — repo hygiene + workflows**

`.gitignore` at repo root:

```
.venv/
__pycache__/
*.pyc
.aws-sam/
.env
```

Add `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (§7, backend version). Hold off on `deploy-backend.yml`/`deploy-lambdas.yml` until the AWS side (§3, §5, §6) exists — a deploy workflow that can only fail is noise.

**Step 10 — first push and verification**

```bash
cd ..            # back to repo root
git add -A
git commit -m "Scaffold backend repo: FastAPI skeleton, Alembic, deploy assets, SAM lambdas, CI"
git push -u origin main
```

**Verify:** GitHub → Actions → the `ci` run is green: the `changes` job detects both components, `backend` runs ruff + alembic + pytest against the Postgres service container, `lambdas` runs its smoke test.

**Step 11 — post-push configuration**

1. Branch protection (§2.2) — the `ci / backend` and `ci / lambdas` checks are now selectable.
2. Environments (§2.3).
3. Invite the BE team: repo → **Settings → Collaborators** → add Thanh and Nguyen (Write), or:

```bash
gh api -X PUT repos/<GH_ORG>/court-booking-backend/collaborators/<username> -f permission=push
```

From here, Thanh & Nguyen branch off `main`, implement the routers per the unified API design ([Architecture Design §6.1](../2.1-architecture/)), and every PR gets the full quality gate automatically.

### 3. AWS One-Time Preparation

#### 3.1 OIDC identity provider (no AWS keys in GitHub!)

GitHub Actions will assume IAM roles via OpenID Connect. Create the provider once:

```bash
aws iam create-open-id-connect-provider \
  --url https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com \
  --client-id-list sts.amazonaws.com
```

#### 3.2 Deploy role — backend pipeline

`trust-backend.json` — only workflows from the **backend repo** can assume it. (The frontend repo needs no AWS role at all: Amplify performs its own deployments.)

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "Federated": "arn:aws:iam::<ACCOUNT_ID>:oidc-provider/token.actions.githubusercontent.com"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity",
      "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
          "token.actions.githubusercontent.com:aud": "sts.amazonaws.com"
        },
        "StringLike": {
          "token.actions.githubusercontent.com:sub": "repo:<GH_ORG>/court-booking-backend:*"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

```bash
aws iam create-role --role-name gh-deploy-backend \
  --assume-role-policy-document file://trust-backend.json
```

Permissions policy (least privilege — S3 revision bucket + CodeDeploy + SSM for migrations):

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": ["s3:PutObject", "s3:GetObject"],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::court-booking-deploy-<ACCOUNT_ID>/*"
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "codedeploy:CreateDeployment",
        "codedeploy:GetDeployment",
        "codedeploy:GetDeploymentConfig",
        "codedeploy:RegisterApplicationRevision",
        "codedeploy:GetApplicationRevision"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": ["ssm:SendCommand", "ssm:GetCommandInvocation"],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

```bash
aws iam put-role-policy --role-name gh-deploy-backend \
  --policy-name deploy-permissions --policy-document file://policy-backend.json
```

#### 3.3 Deploy role — lambda pipeline

Same trust policy → role `gh-deploy-lambdas`. Attach permissions for SAM/CloudFormation deploys (CloudFormation on stack `court-booking-payment*`, `iam:PassRole` for the SAM-created function roles, S3 for the SAM artifact bucket, and Lambda/APIGW/SNS write actions). For the 8-week project scope, `PowerUserAccess` scoped by a permissions boundary is an acceptable shortcut — tighten later.

#### 3.4 Artifact bucket

```bash
aws s3 mb s3://court-booking-deploy-<ACCOUNT_ID> --region <REGION>
aws s3api put-bucket-versioning --bucket court-booking-deploy-<ACCOUNT_ID> \
  --versioning-configuration Status=Enabled
```

#### 3.5 Runtime secrets in SSM Parameter Store

Never put DB credentials in GitHub. The app reads them at startup from SSM:

```bash
aws ssm put-parameter --name /court-booking/dev/DATABASE_URL \
  --type SecureString --value "postgresql://app:<PASSWORD>@<RDS_ENDPOINT>:5432/courtbooking_dev"
aws ssm put-parameter --name /court-booking/prod/DATABASE_URL \
  --type SecureString --value "postgresql://app:<PASSWORD>@<RDS_ENDPOINT>:5432/courtbooking"
# likewise: /court-booking/<env>/COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID, /COGNITO_CLIENT_ID, /SNS_TOPIC_ARN ...
```

---

### 4. Frontend — Amplify Hosting (built-in CI/CD)

#### 4.1 Build spec

`amplify.yml` at the root of `court-booking-frontend` (a dedicated repo means no monorepo wrapper is needed):

```yaml
version: 1
frontend:
  phases:
    preBuild:
      commands:
        - npm ci
    build:
      commands:
        - npm run build
  artifacts:
    baseDirectory: dist
    files:
      - "**/*"
  cache:
    paths:
      - node_modules/**/*
```

#### 4.2 Connect the repo

1. Console → **Amplify → Create new app → GitHub** → authorize → select `<GH_ORG>/court-booking-frontend`, branch `main` (no app-root prompt — the repo root *is* the app).
2. **Environment variables**: `VITE_API_URL = https://<ELB_DNS_or_domain>/api/v1`.
3. **App settings → Previews → Enable pull request previews** on `main` — every PR gets its own URL (this is Danh & Hung's review loop).
4. SPA routing — **Rewrites and redirects**, add a 200 (Rewrite) rule from
   `</^[^.]+$|\.(?!(css|js|map|json|png|svg|jpg|ico|txt|woff2?)$)([^.]+$)/>` to `/index.html`.

**Verify:** push a commit to the frontend repo → Amplify console shows the build → the hosted URL serves the app. Open a PR → a preview URL appears in the PR checks.

#### 4.3 API contract check (the price of two repos, paid once)

With separate repos, an endpoint change and its UI usage no longer land in one PR — so drift between the FastAPI contract and the frontend types must be caught mechanically. FastAPI already publishes its schema at `/openapi.json`; the frontend CI regenerates its client types from the **dev** backend and fails if they changed without being committed:

```yaml
  contract:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with: { node-version: 20 }
      - name: Pull backend OpenAPI schema (dev)
        run: curl -fsS https://<DEV_ELB_DNS>/openapi.json -o /tmp/openapi.json
      - name: Regenerate client types
        run: npx openapi-typescript /tmp/openapi.json -o src/api/schema.d.ts
      - name: Fail on uncommitted drift
        run: git diff --exit-code src/api/schema.d.ts
```

A backend contract change then breaks the frontend's `contract` check loudly at PR time — instead of silently at runtime. When it fires, the fix is one command locally: rerun `openapi-typescript`, commit the regenerated `schema.d.ts`, and let `tsc` point at every UI usage that needs updating.

### 5. Backend — EC2/ASG via CodeDeploy

#### 5.1 EC2 instance role

The instances need to _pull_ revisions and _read_ SSM parameters. Create role `court-booking-ec2` (EC2 trust) with:

- `AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore` (Session Manager + Run Command — also used for migrations)
- Inline: `s3:GetObject` on `arn:aws:s3:::court-booking-deploy-<ACCOUNT_ID>/*`
- Inline: `ssm:GetParameter*` on `arn:aws:ssm:<REGION>:<ACCOUNT_ID>:parameter/court-booking/*` + `kms:Decrypt` on the default SSM key

Attach as **instance profile** in the launch template.

#### 5.2 Launch template user-data (CodeDeploy agent + app runtime)

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -euo pipefail
dnf install -y ruby wget python3.12 python3.12-pip     # Amazon Linux 2023
cd /home/ec2-user
wget https://aws-codedeploy-<REGION>.s3.<REGION>.amazonaws.com/latest/install
chmod +x ./install && ./install auto
systemctl enable codedeploy-agent --now
useradd -r -s /sbin/nologin fastapi || true
mkdir -p /opt/court-booking && chown fastapi:fastapi /opt/court-booking
```

> The agent polls CodeDeploy on boot — this is what makes deployments **Auto-Scaling-safe**: any instance the ASG launches later automatically installs the latest revision before entering service.

systemd unit `/etc/systemd/system/court-booking.service` (installed by the deploy hook below):

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Court Booking FastAPI
After=network.target

[Service]
User=fastapi
WorkingDirectory=/opt/court-booking
Environment=APP_ENV=prod
ExecStart=/opt/court-booking/.venv/bin/gunicorn app.main:app \
  -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker -w 2 -b 0.0.0.0:8000
Restart=always

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

#### 5.3 CodeDeploy application + deployment group

```bash
aws deploy create-application --application-name court-booking-backend

# service role for CodeDeploy itself
aws iam create-role --role-name codedeploy-service \
  --assume-role-policy-document '{"Version":"2012-10-17","Statement":[{"Effect":"Allow","Principal":{"Service":"codedeploy.amazonaws.com"},"Action":"sts:AssumeRole"}]}'
aws iam attach-role-policy --role-name codedeploy-service \
  --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/service-role/AWSCodeDeployRole

aws deploy create-deployment-group \
  --application-name court-booking-backend \
  --deployment-group-name prod \
  --service-role-arn arn:aws:iam::<ACCOUNT_ID>:role/codedeploy-service \
  --auto-scaling-groups court-booking-asg \
  --deployment-config-name CodeDeployDefault.OneAtATime \
  --load-balancer-info targetGroupInfoList=[{name=court-booking-tg}]
```

`OneAtATime` + target-group integration = rolling deploy: each instance is deregistered from the ELB, updated, health-checked, re-registered — **zero downtime with 2 instances**.

#### 5.4 appspec.yml + hook scripts

`backend/deploy/appspec.yml`:

```yaml
version: 0.0
os: linux
files:
  - source: /
    destination: /opt/court-booking
    overwrite: true
file_exists_behavior: OVERWRITE
hooks:
  ApplicationStop:
    - location: deploy/scripts/stop.sh
      timeout: 60
  AfterInstall:
    - location: deploy/scripts/install.sh
      timeout: 300
  ApplicationStart:
    - location: deploy/scripts/start.sh
      timeout: 60
  ValidateService:
    - location: deploy/scripts/validate.sh
      timeout: 120
```

`backend/deploy/scripts/stop.sh`

```bash
#!/bin/bash
systemctl stop court-booking || true
```

`backend/deploy/scripts/install.sh`

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -euo pipefail
cd /opt/court-booking
python3.12 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install --upgrade pip
.venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
cp deploy/court-booking.service /etc/systemd/system/court-booking.service
systemctl daemon-reload
chown -R fastapi:fastapi /opt/court-booking
```

`backend/deploy/scripts/start.sh`

```bash
#!/bin/bash
systemctl start court-booking
```

`backend/deploy/scripts/validate.sh`

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -euo pipefail
for i in $(seq 1 24); do
  curl -fsS http://localhost:8000/api/v1/health && exit 0
  sleep 5
done
echo "health check failed" >&2; exit 1
```

> `validate.sh` failing ⇒ CodeDeploy marks the deployment failed and (with rollback enabled) reverts to the previous revision automatically. Implement `GET /api/v1/health` in FastAPI on day one — it's also the ELB health-check path.

#### 5.5 GitHub Actions workflow

`.github/workflows/deploy-backend.yml`:

```yaml

      - name: Create CodeDeploy deployment

          aws deploy wait deployment-successful --deployment-id "$DID"
```

> **Migration ordering rule:** migrations run _before_ the new code deploys, so every migration must be **backwards-compatible with the currently running code** (add columns as nullable, never drop-and-rename in one release). This is the only discipline the team must learn about zero-downtime deploys.

**Verify:** merge a trivial change under `backend/` → Actions runs tests → waits at the `prod` gate → approve → CodeDeploy console shows the OneAtATime rollout → `curl https://<ELB_DNS>/api/v1/health` returns 200.

### 6. Lambdas — SAM Pipeline

#### 6.1 SAM template

`lambdas/template.yaml` (skeleton — the two functions from the architecture, VPC-attached to reach RDS):

    branches: [main]
    paths: ["lambdas/**"]

permissions: { id-token: write, contents: read }
concurrency: deploy-lambdas

```

**Verify:** merge a change under `lambdas/` → stack `court-booking-payment-prod` updates in CloudFormation → `curl -X POST <WebhookUrl>` with a test payload → check the function's CloudWatch log group.

### 7. PR Checks (the quality gate)

Each repo carries its own `ci.yml`. The frontend one is trivially simple (no path filtering needed — the whole repo is one app); the backend one keeps a filter only to separate its two internal components.

**`court-booking-frontend/.github/workflows/ci.yml`:**

```yaml

        with: { node-version: 20, cache: npm }
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npx tsc --noEmit && npx eslint src && npx vitest run
